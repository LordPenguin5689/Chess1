Queen is just a combination of bishop and rook so just needed to copy and paste the code from them and change slightly. Directions are as follows:
Direction1 - Diagonally up and left
Direction2 - Diagonally up and right
Direction3 - Diagonally down and right
Direction4 - Diagonally down and left.
Direction5 - Straight up
Direction6 - Straight right
Direction7 - Straight down
Direction8 - Straight left

Checks are not coded yet but that will be next.
