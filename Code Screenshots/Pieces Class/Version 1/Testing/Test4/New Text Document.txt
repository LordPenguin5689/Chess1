Entering an anomalous "piece", this time White Potato. I haven't accounted for this in my code yet so interested to see the output if it doesn't just crash.
It returned:
-858993460
w
I assume the weird number is due to an overflow error so I went ahead and just adjusted the code to make an exception when a weird "piece" is passed to the constructor. Output:
Error in generating key. Defaulting to 0.
0
w
So successful here.
